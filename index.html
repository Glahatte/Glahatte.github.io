        <p>
        Born and raised in Augusta Georgia, I attended Aquinas High School
      and subsequently Augusta University in which I graduated with a degree in Political Science
       with a focus on counter-terrorism and security. 
    </p>During my time at Augusta Univeristy I joined several clubs, and was a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity. I held numerous officer positions in the chapter and assisted in consistently doubling the chapter size every year for three years straight.

    Computer History  </p>
      <p>I started working with computers at a young age  and would build my first working desktop when I was sixteen. 
      I worked for months at a local resturant to save up enough money to build "Thor". I received the last of my parts on Christmas Day
      and spent the majority of my Christmas afternoon completing my first rig. 
      </p>
      <p> The excitment of powering on my computer for the first time, along with the "fun" of troubleshooting issues that
        popped up during the building process was remarkable. I was extremely proud of myself for having built Thor all by myself 
        (with the help of some Youtube videos and Reddit guides as well)
      </p>
   
      <p>
        After that day my love of computers was solidified. Thor fought the good fight for seven long years but eventually he became outdated.
        I donated Thor to my cousin who was a fan of PC gaming but did not have a PC himself. He was extremely excited and to this day is one of my favorite memories
        passing on my old computer to my cousin.

        Life After Graduation
      </p>
    <p>
      After graduating from Augusta University I began job searching. Despite my best efforts the job market for political science majors
      was not as strong as I was hoping it would be, with no desire to go to law school after working in a law firm for several years and 
      witnessing first hand the stress that being a lawyer is I decided to go back to school, though I wasn't sure for what.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered getting my masters degree in security studies, but another two years of school without a full-time job was not on my agenda.
      As much as I love Augusta I have lived here for twenty-five years. It was time for me to move on, and move out.

        Getting Started With the Clubhou.se
  </p>
      As I was attending a job fair hosted at the <a href="https://www.gacybercenter.org/">Georgia Cyber Center</a> I met several 
      members of <a href="https://www.theclubhou.se/">TheClubHouse</a> who told me about their full stack web development bootcamp. I was immediatly interested
      and registered for the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started class in early september, and here we are! I have learned a lot in the past month alone and am extremely excited for the future.
