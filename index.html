      <div id= "aboutMe"> I was born in Augusta, GA. I attended Aquinas Highschool where I was a participant in numerous activities including the drama club, model united nations, the rifle team, and various other clubs.</div>
    <div id= "collegeExperience">
     
        At Augusta Univeristy I was a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity where I served in numerous officer positions and lived in the house for three years. I also served on the student council judicial board and volunteered with numerous organizations. I participated in a study abroad for political science majors where we attended the National Model United Nations. The trip was a blast and we almost went to war with Armenia like six times. 
   
    </div>
  
        I graduated from <a href="Augusta.edu">Augusta University </a>. I decided to further my education after being unable to find a job with my <span class= three> political science </span>degree.

       Inspiration hit me after I attended a job fair at the <a href="https://www.gacybercenter.org/">Georgia Cyber Center</a> and met the people in charge of the Clubhouse.
