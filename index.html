      <div> I was born in Augusta, GA. I attended Aquinas Highschool where I was a participant in numerous activities including the drama club, model united nations, the rifle team, and various other clubs.
  
        I graduated from <a href="Augusta.edu">Augusta University </a>. I decided to further my education after being unable to find a job with my <span class= three> political science </span>degree.

       Inspiration hit me after I attended a job fair at the <a href="https://www.gacybercenter.org/">Georgia Cyber Center</a> and met the people in charge of the Clubhouse.
